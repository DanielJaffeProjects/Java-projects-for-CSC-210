# Java Projects for CSC 210

## Overview

Welcome to the **Java Projects for CSC 210** repository! This repository contains two Java programs developed as part of the **CSC 210** course. These programs explore core concepts in computer science, including **cache memory simulation** and **number base conversions**. Each project demonstrates key principles such as system interaction, file handling, and error detection.

## Projects Included

### **1. Cache Memory Simulation**
- **Description**:  
  This program simulates the interaction between a **CPU** and **cache memory**. It calculates and displays the **cache hit ratio** while demonstrating how caching improves performance by reducing access time to frequently used data.

---

### **2. Number Base Conversion with Overflow Detection**
- **Description**:  
  This program processes a file containing numerical data, converts the numbers from one base to another, and checks for overflow during the conversion process. It provides a useful tool for understanding base arithmetic and handling large numbers.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of these projects is to provide hands-on experience with:

1. **System-Level Programming**: Simulating cache memory and CPU interactions to understand system architecture concepts.
2. **Base Conversions and Error Handling**: Implementing base conversion algorithms with robust error detection to handle overflow.
